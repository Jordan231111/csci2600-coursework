# CSCI 2600 - Coursework

This repository contains my coursework for CSCI 2600 - Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Structure

The repository is organized into separate homework assignments:

- `csci2600-hw0`: Introduction homework
- `csci2600-hw1`: Homework 1 
- `csci2600-hw2`: Homework 2
- `csci2600-hw3`: Homework 3
- `csci2600-hw4`: Homework 4

Each homework directory contains source code, tests, and documentation.

## Building and Running

Most assignments use Gradle as the build system. To build and run a specific homework:

```bash
cd csci2600-hwX
./gradlew build
./gradlew test
```
