\section*{Homework 6: Collaboration Statement}

I did not collaborate with other students on this assignment.

I did consult the following resources to better understand the concepts involved in this assignment:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Java documentation for generics and the PriorityQueue class
    \item The textbook chapter on Dijkstra's algorithm
    \item Class lecture notes on graph algorithms and generic programming
\end{itemize}

When implementing Dijkstra's algorithm, I followed the pseudocode provided in the assignment, adapting it to work with my generic Graph implementation. I made design decisions independently regarding how to structure the GraphAlgorithms class and how to integrate it with the LegoPaths application.
